## Experience

### Winbond — Leveraging AI to Improve Manufacturing Operations (Taichung, Taiwan)  
**Software Engineer Intern** (July 2024 – August 2024)

- **AI Log Intelligence Platform:** Designed and implemented an AI-powered manufacturing log intelligence system by ingesting factory error-reporting APIs into Elasticsearch, performing data normalization, chunking, and vectorization for downstream LLM-based root-cause analysis and troubleshooting.
- **Multimodal AI Assistant:** Built a production-oriented multimodal AI assistant that processes natural-language queries and image inputs via LangChain-based retrieval pipelines to support manufacturing troubleshooting.
- **System Automation:** Implemented scheduled data ingestion and indexing pipelines to ensure continuously updated operational knowledge for real-time AI-driven decision support.
- **Impact:** Automated analysis of approximately 50 daily manufacturing error cases, resolving about 50% via AI and reducing manual engineer investigations by around 25 cases per day.

### AI Next Mine — LLMOps and AI Platform Engineering (Remote)  
**AI Engineer Intern** (September 2025 – January 2026)

- **Engineering Document & CAD Intelligence Platform:** Built a containerized, API-driven AI platform supporting over 30 document formats and native CAD engineering drawings, enabling real-time visualization, semantic search, and LLM-powered Q&A over structured design data.
- **Multimodal Retrieval:** Designed an LLM-based pipeline integrating speech (via Whisper transcripts), images, and text into a unified vector database for scalable knowledge retrieval.
- **Impact:** Enabled web-based visualization and AI-driven analysis of CAD engineering drawings, eliminating the need for native CAD software and enabling natural-language queries over structured design data.
